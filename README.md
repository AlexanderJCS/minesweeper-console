## Compatibility

- This is compatible with Windows. This program relies on libraries such as `Windows.h` and `conio.h`, which are not portable.
- Use Visual Studio's C++ compiler for the best experience. This was not tested on any other compiler.
- Consoles that support ANSI Escape Codes are required. cmd on Windows does not support this, instead, use the Terminal application.

## Controls

- Use WASD to navigate your cursor
- Use E to select a space. If you select a bomb, you lose.
- Use Q to flag a space. If all bombs are flagged, you win.

## How to play

Standard Minesweeper rules apply.
